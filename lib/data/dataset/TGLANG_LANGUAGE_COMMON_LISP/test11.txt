;;; By SEGREGATING lexical locations, we mean taking each lexical
;;; location and determining whether it is an exclusive location or a
;;; shared location.  If it is an exclusive location, it can be
;;; allocated on the stack or in a register.  If it a shared location,
;;; we may have to transmit it to inner functions through the static
;;; environment of those functions.  In the worst case, if the
;;; location is assigned to, it may have to be contained in a cell in
;;; the static environment.

;;; The method used here is very simple, and not particularly
;;; sophisticated.  It assumes that every nested function can escape
;;; in arbitrary ways, so that every lexical location that is shared
;;; by some function F and some other function G nested inside F must
;;; be treated as a shared location accordingly.
;;;
;;; LOCATION-OWNERS is an EQ hash table mapping each lexical location
;;; to its owner.
;;;
;;; We return a list of the lexical locations that have been
;;; categorized as shared lexical locations.
