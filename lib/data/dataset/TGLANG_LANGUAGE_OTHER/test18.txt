Why don't you simply revert the roles of your services, keeping in mind that the default service is the one getting all unexpected crap that is not matched by any rules... i.e.exactly what your're apparently expecting from your currently named `frontend` service. Call the other one `backend` or whatever _specific_ function it performs and leave the default service do the default/kitchen sink job it already performs ;) It can be a bit tricky to rename services, see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47575114/how-do-i-deploy-to-a-custom-service-with-the-appengine-gradle-plugin/47577207#47577207
