{"problem": "How many positive integers less than 100 are both a square and a cube?", "level": "Level 2", "type": "Number Theory", "solution": "In order for an integer to be a square and a cube, it must also be a perfect sixth power. The only perfect sixth powers less than 100 are $1^6=1$ and $2^6=64$, so there are only $\\boxed{2}$ positive integers less than 100 that are both a square and a cube."}
