*' @title Livestock
*'
*' @description The livestock module calculates how much and what kind of
*' biomass is required as feed to produce livestock food commodities.
*'
*' For this purpose, the livestock module provides for every time-step regional
*' and product-specific feed baskets that determine type and magnitude of feed
*' needed to produce one unit of livestock commodities. Estimated pasture
*' feed demand is also relevant for the module [31_past] in order to derive
*' required pasture areas. The information flow between the livestock and the
*' pasture module is organized via interfaces `vm_dem_feed`, `vm_supply` and
*' `vm_prod_reg` via modules [16_demand] and [21_trade]. Feed demand estimates
*' are also required for the modules [53_methane] and [55_awms]. Additionally,
*' the livestock module provides production costs for livestock commodities.
