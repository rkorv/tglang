p. The rtextile gem creates a Rails 3 textile editor, enabling your users to add safe, rich text markup to your website.  

p. Rtextile uses the RedCloth gem and a _gemified_ version of the textile_editor_helper plugin. It contains
two generators, *rtextile* and *textile_editor_helper* that create all the files you need to get up and running
quickly and easily.

h4. rtextile generator:

p. Generates scaffold. Files created: migration, controller, model, view templates and routes.
	 	
h4. Usage:

p. The generator takes three arguments, name(model), the objects title and the object itself.

bq. Example:
rails generate rtextile document title post
This will generate a migration for model(document) with title(string) and post(text), controller, model, view templates and routes. After running the generator, run your migration and run the textile_editor_helper generator:

h4. textile_editor_helper generator:

p. The textile_editor_helper generator is a gemified version of the plugin by the same name. Credit goes to   the original authors: Dave Olsen (Javascript) and Chris Scharf (Ruby/Rails) of West Virginia University Web Services (http://webservices.wvu.edu/) and to  ryanfelton (https://github.com/ryanfelton/textile-editor-helper) for making the plugin rails 3 compatable.        
   
p. *Notice:* The textile_editor_helper requires prototype. If you prefer to use jquery, edit the initialization line in the form partial to:

pre. <%= textile_editor_initialize(:framework => :jQuery) %>

bq. Example:
rails generate textile_editor_helper
This will create: Javascripts, css and image files.
